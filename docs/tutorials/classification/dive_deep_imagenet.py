"""5. Train Your Own Model on ImageNet
==========================================

``ImageNet`` is the most well-known dataset for image classification.
Since it was published, most of the research that advances the state-of-the-art
of image classification was based on this dataset.

Although there are a lot of available models, it is still a non-trivial task to
train a state-of-the-art model on ``ImageNet`` from scratch.
In this tutorial, we will smoothly walk
you through the process of training a model on ``ImageNet``.

.. note::

    The rest of the tutorial walks you through the details of ``ImageNet`` training.
    If you want a quick start without knowing the details, try downloading
    this script and start training with just one command.

    :download:`Download train_imagenet.py<../../../scripts/classification/imagenet/train_imagenet.py>`

    The commands used to reproduce results from papers are given in our
    `Model Zoo <../../model_zoo/index.html>`__.

.. note::

    Since real training is extremely resource consuming, we don't actually
    execute code blocks in this tutorial.


Prerequisites
-------------

**Expertise**

We assume readers have a basic understanding of ``Gluon``, we suggest
you start with `Gluon Crash Course <http://gluon-crash-course.mxnet.io/index.html>`__ .

Also, we assume that readers have gone through previous tutorials on
`CIFAR10 Training <dive_deep_cifar10.html>`_ and `ImageNet Demo <demo_imagenet.html>`_ .

**Data Preparation**

Unlike ``CIFAR10``, we need to prepare the data manually.
If you haven't done so, please go through our tutorial on
`Prepare ImageNet Data <../examples_datasets/imagenet.html>`_ .

**Hardware**

Training deep learning models on a dataset of over one million images is
very resource demanding.
Two main bottlenecks are tensor computation and data IO.

For tensor computation, it is recommended to use a GPU, preferably a high-end
one.
Using multiple GPUs together will further reduce training time.

For data IO, we recommend a fast CPU and a SSD disk. Data loading can greatly benefit
from multiple CPU threads, and a fast SSD disk. Note that in total the compressed
and extracted ``ImageNet`` data could occupy around 300GB disk space, thus a SSD with
at least 300GB is required.

Network structure
-----------------

Finished preparation? Let's get started!

First, import the necessary libraries into python.

.. code-block:: python

    import argparse, time

    import numpy as np
    import mxnet as mx

    from mxnet import gluon, nd
    from mxnet import autograd as ag
    from mxnet.gluon import nn
    from mxnet.gluon.data.vision import transforms

    from gluoncv.model_zoo import get_model
    from gluoncv.utils import makedirs, TrainingHistory

In this tutorial we use ``ResNet50_v2``, a network with balanced prediction
accuracy and computational cost.

.. code-block:: python

    # number of GPUs to use
    num_gpus = 4
    ctx = [mx.gpu(i) for i in range(num_gpus)]

    # Get the model ResNet50_v2, with 10 output classes
    net = get_model('ResNet50_v2', classes=1000)
    net.initialize(mx.init.MSRAPrelu(), ctx = ctx)


Note that the ResNet model we use here for ``ImageNet`` is different in structure from
the one we used to train ``CIFAR10``. Please refer to the original paper or
GluonCV codebase for details.

Data Augmentation and Data Loader
---------------------------------

Data augmentation is essential for a good result. It is similar to what we have
in the ``CIFAR10`` training tutorial, just different in the parameters.

We compose our transform functions as following:

.. code-block:: python

    jitter_param = 0.4
    lighting_param = 0.1

    transform_train = transforms.Compose([
        transforms.RandomResizedCrop(224),
        transforms.RandomFlipLeftRight(),
        transforms.RandomColorJitter(brightness=jitter_param, contrast=jitter_param,
                                     saturation=jitter_param),
        transforms.RandomLighting(lighting_param),
        transforms.ToTensor(),
        transforms.Normalize([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], [0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
    ])


Since ``ImageNet`` images have much higher resolution and quality than
``CIFAR10``, we can crop a larger image (224x224) as input to the model.

For prediction, we still need deterministic results. The transform function is:

.. code-block:: python

    transform_test = transforms.Compose([
        transforms.Resize(256),
        transforms.CenterCrop(224),
        transforms.ToTensor(),
        transforms.Normalize([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], [0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
    ])

Notice that it is important to keep the normalization consistent, since trained
model only works well on test data from the same distribution.

With the transform functions, we can define data loaders for our
training and validation datasets.

.. code-block:: python

    # Batch Size for Each GPU
    per_device_batch_size = 64
    # Number of data loader workers
    num_workers = 32
    # Calculate effective total batch size
    batch_size = per_device_batch_size * num_gpus

    data_path = '~/.mxnet/datasets/imagenet'

    # Set train=True for training data
    # Set shuffle=True to shuffle the training data
    train_data = gluon.data.DataLoader(
        imagenet.classification.ImageNet(data_path, train=True).transform_first(transform_train),
        batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True, last_batch='discard', num_workers=num_workers)

    # Set train=False for validation data
    val_data = gluon.data.DataLoader(
        imagenet.classification.ImageNet(data_path, train=False).transform_first(transform_test),
        batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=False, num_workers=num_workers)

Note that we set ``per_device_batch_size=64``, which may not suit GPUs with
Memory smaller than 12GB. Please tune the value according to your specific configuration.

Path ``'~/.mxnet/datasets/imagenet'`` is the default path if you
prepared the data `with our script <../examples_datasets/imagenet.html>`_.

Optimizer, Loss and Metric
--------------------------

Optimizer is what improves the model during training. We use the popular
Nesterov accelerated gradient descent algorithm.

.. code-block:: python

    # Learning rate decay factor
    lr_decay = 0.1
    # Epochs where learning rate decays
    lr_decay_epoch = [30, 60, 90, np.inf]

    # Nesterov accelerated gradient descent
    optimizer = 'nag'
    # Set parameters
    optimizer_params = {'learning_rate': 0.1, 'wd': 0.0001, 'momentum': 0.9}

    # Define our trainer for net
    trainer = gluon.Trainer(net.collect_params(), optimizer, optimizer_params)


For classification tasks, we usually use softmax cross entropy as the
loss function.

.. code-block:: python

    loss_fn = gluon.loss.SoftmaxCrossEntropyLoss()


With 1000 classes the model may not always rate the correct answer with the highest
rank. Besides top-1 accuracy, we also consider top-5 accuracy as a measurement
of how well the model is doing.

At the end of every epoch, we record and print the metric scores.

.. code-block:: python

    acc_top1 = mx.metric.Accuracy()
    acc_top5 = mx.metric.TopKAccuracy(5)
    train_history = TrainingHistory(['training-top1-err', 'training-top5-err',
                                     'validation-top1-err', 'validation-top5-err'])

Validation
----------

At the end of every training epoch, we evaluate it on the validation data set,
and report the top-1 and top-5 error rate.

.. code-block:: python

    def test(ctx, val_data):
        acc_top1_val = mx.metric.Accuracy()
        acc_top5_val = mx.metric.TopKAccuracy(5)
        for i, batch in enumerate(val_data):
            data = gluon.utils.split_and_load(batch[0], ctx_list=ctx, batch_axis=0)
            label = gluon.utils.split_and_load(batch[1], ctx_list=ctx, batch_axis=0)
            outputs = [net(X) for X in data]
            acc_top1_val.update(label, outputs)
            acc_top5_val.update(label, outputs)

        _, top1 = acc_top1_val.get()
        _, top5 = acc_top5_val.get()
        return (1 - top1, 1 - top5)

Training
--------

After all these preparation, we can finally start training!
Following is the main training loop:

.. code-block:: python

    epochs = 120
    lr_decay_count = 0
    log_interval = 50
    num_batch = len(train_data)

    for epoch in range(epochs):
        tic = time.time()
        btic = time.time()
        acc_top1.reset()
        acc_top5.reset()
        train_loss = 0

        if lr_decay_period == 0 and epoch == lr_decay_epoch[lr_decay_count]:
            trainer.set_learning_rate(trainer.learning_rate*lr_decay)
            lr_decay_count += 1

        for i, batch in enumerate(train_data):
            data = gluon.utils.split_and_load(batch[0], ctx_list=ctx, batch_axis=0)
            label = gluon.utils.split_and_load(batch[1], ctx_list=ctx, batch_axis=0)
            with ag.record():
                outputs = [net(X) for X in data]
                loss = [L(yhat, y) for yhat, y in zip(outputs, label)]
            ag.backward(loss)
            trainer.step(batch_size)
            acc_top1.update(label, outputs)
            acc_top5.update(label, outputs)
            train_loss += sum([l.sum().asscalar() for l in loss])
            if log_interval and not (i + 1) % log_interval:
                _, top1 = acc_top1.get()
                _, top5 = acc_top5.get()
                err_top1, err_top5 = (1-top1, 1-top5)
                print('Epoch[%d] Batch [%d]\tSpeed: %f samples/sec\ttop1-err=%f\ttop5-err=%f'%(
                          epoch, i, batch_size*opt.log_interval/(time.time()-btic), err_top1, err_top5))
                btic = time.time()

        _, top1 = acc_top1.get()
        _, top5 = acc_top5.get()
        err_top1, err_top5 = (1-top1, 1-top5)
        train_loss /= num_batch * batch_size

        err_top1_val, err_top5_val = test(ctx, val_data)
        train_history.update([err_top1, err_top5, err_top1_val, err_top5_val])

        print('[Epoch %d] training: err-top1=%f err-top5=%f loss=%f'%(epoch, err_top1, err_top5, train_loss))
        print('[Epoch %d] time cost: %f'%(epoch, time.time()-tic))
        print('[Epoch %d] validation: err-top1=%f err-top5=%f'%(epoch, err_top1_val, err_top5_val))


We can plot the top-1 error rates with:

.. code-block:: python

    train_history.plot(['training-top1-err', 'validation-top1-err'])

If you train the model with ``epochs=120``, the plot may look like:

Next Step
---------

`Model Zoo <../../model_zoo/index.html>`_ provides scripts and commands for
training models on ``ImageNet``.

If you want to know what you can do with the model you just
trained, please read the tutorial on `Transfer learning <transfer_learning_minc.html>`__.

Besides classification, deep learning models nowadays can do other exciting tasks
like `object detection <../examples_detection/index.html>`_ and
`semantic segmentation <../examples_segmentation/index.html>`_.
